"""django_todo URL Configuration

The `urlpatterns` list routes URLs to views. For more information please see:
    https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/topics/http/urls/
Examples:
Function views
    1. Add an import:  from my_app import views
    2. Add a URL to urlpatterns:  url(r'^$', views.home, name='home')
Class-based views
    1. Add an import:  from other_app.views import Home
    2. Add a URL to urlpatterns:  url(r'^$', Home.as_view(), name='home')
Including another URLconf
    1. Import the include() function: from django.conf.urls import url, include
    2. Add a URL to urlpatterns:  url(r'^blog/', include('blog.urls'))
"""

"""urlpatterns are similar to the @app.route() functions in Flask. They are mapped 
to a route, and run certain functions when the url is called."""

"""The '^' symbol signifies the start of a path, and the '$' symbol signifies the 
end. For example, the path of '^message$' will only load when the url has 
'message' on the end, however the path of 'message' will load as long as the url 
has 'message' somewhere in the path. """
